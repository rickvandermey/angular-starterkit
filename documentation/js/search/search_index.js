PWA(Progressive Web App), Unit Test (Karma), E2E Test (Protractor / Cucumber)\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 8.x.x.\nOn default this build is compiled with AOT (Ahead of Time

https://angular-ssr.rickvandermeij.nl\n\nPerfect score application\n\nDevelopment server\nRun npm start for a dev server. Navigate to https://localhost:4202/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBecause we are running localhost on SSL (https), you will need to generate a certificate and key, and place them in a folder called build. Run npm run certificate:generate to create the required certificates and place them in the required folder. Another way to create those can be found here. The build map should already be in your .gitignore.\nWhen developing, Husky is implemented, which means you only can commit when there are no linting errors, and all unit-tests succeeds. Other commmands can be implemented in the package.json.\nBuild\nRun npm run build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build. When building all ununsed CSS will be removed by the purgeCSS plugin.\nRun npm run build:gzip to build the project and then gzip the files if neccesary.\nIvy Build\nTo create an Ivy build, you'll need to update src/tsconfig.app.json and set enableIvy: true. Be aware when doing this, functionality for SSR and Prerendering won't work at this moment. Maybe when updating in the future, it will.\nExtend the Angular CLI settings (Webpack)\nIt is possible to extend the Angular CLI settings via a Webpack partial. Angular CLI will still optimize all functionality without being ejected. The Webpack Partial still gives you the opportunity the specify certain extra configurations in Webpack.\nServer Side Rendering (SSR)\nThis project comes with built-in SSR functionality. The effect of SSR will be valuable on larger projects or slower internet connections, run Google Audit with slow network to see the difference.\n\nFor Serving, run npm run start:ssr\nFor Building, run npm run ssr:build\n\nPrerendering Angular\n\nFor Serving, run npm run start:prerender\nFor Building, run npm run prerender:build\n\nTesting\nRun npm run lint for linting your application.\nRunning unit tests with Karma\nRun npm run test to execute the unit tests via Karma. This script will be run as a watcher. Most effective to run this alongside npm run start while developing.\nRun test:unit-headless to execute a single run for the Unit test. Best usecases are for pre-commit checks and in pipeline scripts.\nBoth scripts will provide a Code Coverage file, which can be found in './reports/coverage'\nRunning E2E tests with Protractor and Cucumber\nRun npm run test:e2e to execute the E2E protractor tests. Tests can be found within ./features all written in Cucumber style.\nThis test will provide an report which will be shown at the end of all tests. It can also be found in ./reports/e2e/report. When tests fails, there will be a screenshot attached to the scenario where the test has failed.\nAnalyzing\nRun npm run wpo:stats to get a clear view of all dependencies and their dependencies for your project.\nDocumentation\nRun npm run doc to generate a compodoc containing documentation for all the modules, routes and other components of the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2019 Rick van der Meij\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
