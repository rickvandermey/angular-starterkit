--NGX translate--\nPowerful Starterkit combining all latest advanced Angular features. Strict typescript mode and preventing pushing untested code. Read more for all features.\nQuickstart for MAC: npm run certificate:generate:mac && npm run start:clean\nQuickstart for Windows: remove ssl from serve inside 'angular.json' and npm run start:clean\nFeatures\n\nModern vs. Legacy build (ES5 vs ES2015)\nIVY opt-in\nNGRX store (implemented according ngrx.io)\nLazy Loading\nHttpInterceptor\nNGX-Translate (assets/i18n/{locale}.json)\nSSR (Server Side Rendering)\nPrerendering\nPWA (Progressive Web App)\nService Worker detects new build versions\nUnit Test (Karma)\nE2E Test / Reports (Protractor / Cucumber)\nDocumentation Generation (Compodoc)\nWPO: Google Lighthouse reporter (save to Compodoc additional docs)\nWPO: Stats for ES5 build and ES2015\nGit hooks (husky)\nExtend Angular CLI (webpack)\nAbility to Mock data (mockServer)\n\nexample sites:\n\nIVY build - https://angular.rickvandermeij.nl\nPrerendering (no IVY) - https://angular-prerender.rickvandermeij.nl\nServer Side Rendering (no IVY) - npm run start:ssr\n\nPerfect score application\n\nDevelopment server\nnpm run start available at https://localhost:4202/ (Hot reloading enabled)\nnpm run start:mock will use the mock environment, which connects with the mockServer at http://localhost:4000\nBecause we are running localhost on SSL (https), you will need to generate a certificate and key, and place them in a folder called build. Run npm run certificate:generate:mac to create the required certificates and place them in the required folder.\nGit hooks\nGit hooks are active, which means you only can commit when there are no linting errors, and all unit-tests succeeds. Other commmands can be implemented in the package.json with husky.\nBuild\n\nnpm run build - normal production build\nnpm run build:gzip - production build with files already gzipped\nnpm run prerender:build - npm run build:gzip with prerendering all routes\nnpm run ssr:build- production build with Server Side Rendering\n\nIvy Build\nTo create an Ivy build, you'll need to update src/tsconfig.app.json and set enableIvy: true.\nNOTE: Be aware when doing this, functionality for SSR and Prerendering won't work at this moment (Angular 8.x.x).\nServer Side Rendering (SSR)\nThis project comes with built-in SSR functionality. The effect of SSR will be valuable on larger projects or slower internet connections, run Google Audit with slow network to see the difference.\n\nFor Serving - npm run start:ssr\nFor Building - npm run ssr:build\n\nPrerendering Angular\n\nFor Serving - npm run start:prerender\nFor Building - npm run prerender:build\n\nExtend the Angular CLI settings (Webpack)\nIt is possible to extend the Angular CLI settings via a webpack.partial.js. Angular CLI will still optimize all functionality without being ejected. The Webpack Partial still gives you the opportunity the specify certain extra configurations in Webpack.\nTesting\n\nnpm run lint - Linting application\nnpm run test - Unit test Watcher\nnpm run test:unit-headless - Unit test single Run\nnpm run test:e2e - End to End test with Protractor and reports with Cucumber\n\nRunning unit tests with Karma\nRun npm run test to execute the unit tests via Karma. This script will be run as a watcher. Most effective to run this alongside npm run start while developing.\nRun test:unit-headless to execute a single run for the Unit test. Best usecases are for pre-commit checks and in pipeline scripts.\nBoth scripts will provide a Code Coverage file, which can be found in './reports/coverage'\nRunning E2E tests with Protractor and Cucumber\nRun npm run test:e2e to execute the E2E protractor tests. Tests can be found within ./e2e all written in Cucumber style.\nThis test will provide an report which will be shown at the end of all tests. It can also be found in ./reports/e2e/report. When tests fails, there will be a screenshot attached to the scenario where the test has failed.\nKnown issue(s)\nWhen npm run test:e2e fails to compile as of webdriver issues, run npm run test:e2e:fix-webdriver to fix this compile error and try again.\nDocumentation\nWhen IVY is disabled\n\nnpm run doc:full - create documentation with compodoc\nUnit test coverage\nE2E reports\nWPO reports\n\n\n\nWhen IVY is enabled\n\nnpm run doc:full:ivy - create documentation with compodoc\nUnit test coverage\nE2E reports\nWPO reports\n\n\n\nsample can be fount at './documentation/index.html'\nWebsite Performance Optimization\n\nnpm run wpo:stats to get a clear view of all dependencies and their dependencies for your project (when IVY is disabled).\nnpm run wpo:stats-es5 to get a clear view of all dependencies and their dependencies for your project (when IVY is enabled).\nnpm run wpo:stats-es2015 to get a clear view of all dependencies and their dependencies for your project (when IVY is enabled).\nnpm run wpo:lighthouse to get a lighthouse score for your current project. (change the URL in ci/fetchLighthouse.js).\n\nMock data (MockServer)\nAs of version 1.1.0 it is possible to setup a mockServer with npm run server:mock. Port will be http://localhost:4000 and the different status can be set at http://localhost:4000/mocking. All data can be setup in './mockServer'. Examples of API, JSON and images are added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2019 Rick van der Meij\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
