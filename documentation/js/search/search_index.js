advanced Angular features. Strict typescript mode and preventing pushing untested code. Read more for all features.\nFeatures\n\n⭐️ Modern vs. Legacy build (ES5 vs ES2015)\n&#x1F60D; IVY opt-in\n⭐️ NGRX store (implemented according ngrx.io)\n&#x1F634; Lazy Loading\n⭐️ HttpInterceptor\n⭐️ NGX-Translate (assets/i18n/{locale}.json)\n&#x1F680; SSR (Server Side Rendering)\n&#x1F680; Prerendering (for SEO and static HTML generation)\n&#x1F60D; PWA (Progressive Web App)\n&#x1F60D; Service Worker detects new build versions\n&#x1F913; Unit Test (Karma)\n&#x1F913; E2E Test / Reports (Protractor / Cucumber)\n&#x1F5C3; Documentation Generation (Compodoc)\n&#x1F680; WPO: Google Lighthouse reporter (save to Compodoc additional docs)\n&#x1F680; WPO: Stats for ES5 build and ES2015\n&#x1F3AF; Git hooks (husky)\n&#x1F3AF; Extend Angular CLI (webpack)\n&#x1F929; Ability to Mock data (mockServer)\n\nQuickstart:\n\nMAC: npm run certificate:generate:mac && npm run start:clean\nWindows: remove ssl from serve inside 'angular.json' and npm run start:clean\n\nPerfect score application &#x1F929;\n\nDevelopment server\nnpm run start available at https://localhost:4202/ (Hot reloading enabled)\nnpm run start:mock will use the mock environment, which connects with the mockServer at http://localhost:4000\nBecause we are running localhost on SSL (https), you will need to generate a certificate and key, and place them in a folder called build. Run npm run certificate:generate:mac to create the required certificates and place them in the required folder.\nGit hooks &#x1F3AF;\nGit hooks are active, which means you only can commit when there are no linting errors, and all unit-tests succeeds. Other commmands can be implemented in the package.json with husky.\nBuild\n\nnpm run build - normal production build\nnpm run build:gzip - production build with files already gzipped\nnpm run prerender:build - npm run build:gzip with prerendering all routes\nnpm run ssr:build- production build with Server Side Rendering\n\nIvy Build &#x1F60D;\nTo create an Ivy build, you'll need to update src/tsconfig.app.json and set enableIvy: true.\nNOTE: Be aware when doing this, functionality for SSR and Prerendering won't work at this moment (Angular 8.x.x).\nServer Side Rendering (SSR) &#x1F60D;\nThis project comes with built-in SSR functionality. The effect of SSR will be valuable on larger projects or slower internet connections, run Google Audit with slow network to see the difference.\n\nFor Serving - npm run start:ssr\nFor Building - npm run ssr:build\n\nPrerendering Angular &#x1F60D;&#x1F60D;&#x1F60D;\n\nFor Serving - npm run start:prerender\nFor Building - npm run prerender:build\n\nExtend the Angular CLI settings (Webpack) &#x1F3AF;\nIt is possible to extend the Angular CLI settings via a webpack.partial.js. Angular CLI will still optimize all functionality without being ejected. The Webpack Partial still gives you the opportunity the specify certain extra configurations in Webpack.\nTesting\n\nnpm run lint - Linting application\nnpm run test - Unit test Watcher\nnpm run test:unit-headless - Unit test single Run\nnpm run test:e2e - End to End test with Protractor and reports with Cucumber\n\nRunning unit tests with Karma &#x1F913;\nRun npm run test to execute the unit tests via Karma. This script will be run as a watcher. Most effective to run this alongside npm run start while developing.\nRun test:unit-headless to execute a single run for the Unit test. Best usecases are for pre-commit checks and in pipeline scripts.\nBoth scripts will provide a Code Coverage file, which can be found in './reports/coverage'\nRunning E2E tests with Protractor and Cucumber &#x1F913;\nRun npm run test:e2e to execute the E2E protractor tests. Tests can be found within ./e2e all written in Cucumber style.\nThis test will provide an report which will be shown at the end of all tests. It can also be found in ./reports/e2e/report. When tests fails, there will be a screenshot attached to the scenario where the test has failed.\nKnown issue(s) &#x1F48A;\nWhen npm run test:e2e fails to compile as of webdriver issues, run npm run test:e2e:fix-webdriver to fix this compile error and try again.\nDocumentation &#x1F5C3;\n\nnpm run doc:full - create documentation with compodoc\nUnit test coverage\nE2E reports\nWPO reports\n\n\n\nsample can be fount at './documentation/index.html'\nWebsite Performance Optimization &#x1F680;\n\nnpm run wpo:stats to get a clear view of all dependencies and their dependencies for your project (when IVY is disabled).\nnpm run wpo:stats-es5 to get a clear view of all dependencies and their dependencies for your project (when IVY is enabled).\nnpm run wpo:stats-es2015 to get a clear view of all dependencies and their dependencies for your project (when IVY is enabled).\nnpm run wpo:lighthouse to get a lighthouse score for your current project. (change the URL in ci/fetchLighthouse.js).\n\nMock data (MockServer) &#x1F929;\nAs of version 1.1.0 it is possible to setup a mockServer with npm run server:mock. Port will be http://localhost:4000 and the different status can be set at http://localhost:4000/mocking. All data can be setup in './mockServer'.
