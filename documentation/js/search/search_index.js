advanced Angular features. Strict typescript mode and preventing pushing untested code. Read more for all features.\nFeatures\n\n⭐️ Modern vs. Legacy build (ES5 vs ES2015)\n😍 IVY by default\n⭐️ NGRX store (implemented according ngrx.io)\n😴 Lazy Loading\n⭐️ HttpInterceptor\n⭐️ NGX-Translate (assets/i18n/{locale}.json)\n🚀 SSR (Server Side Rendering)\n🚀 Prerendering (for SEO and static HTML generation)\n😍 PWA (Progressive Web App)\n😍 Service Worker detects new build versions\n🤓 Unit Test (Jest)\n🤓 E2E Test / Reports (Protractor / Cucumber)\n🗃 Documentation Generation (Compodoc)\n🚀 WPO: Google Lighthouse reporter (save to Compodoc additional docs)\n🚀 WPO: Stats for ES5 build and ES2015\n🎯 Git hooks (husky)\n🤩 Ability to Mock data (mockServer) (Docker)\n🎰 WebPush integration (mockServer and PWA)\n\nQuickstart:\n\nMAC: npm run certificate:generate:mac && npm run start:clean\nWindows: remove ssl from serve inside 'angular.json' and npm run start:clean\n\nPerfect score application 🤩\n\nDevelopment server\nnpm run start available at https://localhost:4202/ (Hot reloading enabled)\nnpm run start:mock will use the mock environment, which connects with the mockServer at https://localhost:4000\nBecause we are running localhost on SSL (https), you will need to generate a certificate and key, and place them in a folder called build. Run npm run certificate:generate:mac to create the required certificates and place them in the required folder.\nGit hooks 🎯\nGit hooks are active, which means you only can commit when there are no linting errors, and all unit-tests succeeds. Other commmands can be implemented in the package.json with husky.\nWhen using nvm, the default node should be > 10. nvm alias stable default\nBuild\n\nnpm run build - normal production build\nnpm run build:gzip - production build with files already gzipped\nnpm run prerender:build - npm run build:gzip with prerendering all routes\nnpm run ssr:build- production build with Server Side Rendering\n\nIvy Build 😍\nIvy is set to true by default and works with SSR / Prerendering\nServer Side Rendering (SSR) 😍\nThis project comes with built-in SSR functionality. The effect of SSR will be valuable on larger projects or slower internet connections, run Google Audit with slow network to see the difference.\n\nFor Serving - npm run start:ssr\nFor Building - npm run ssr:build\n\nPrerendering Angular 😍😍😍\n\nFor Serving - npm run start:prerender\nFor Building - npm run prerender:build\n\nTesting\n\nnpm run lint - Linting application\nnpm run test - Unit test Watcher (only runs tests for changed files)\nnpm run test-all - Unit test Watcher (runs all tests)\nnpm run test:ci - Unit test single Run\nnpm run test:e2e - End to End test with Protractor and reports with Cucumber\n\nRunning unit tests with Jest 🤓\nRun npm run test to execute the unit tests via Jest. This script will be run as a watcher and only runs tests for changed files. Most effective to run this alongside npm run start while developing.\nRun test-all to execute a all unit tests when a file change.\nRun test:ci to execute a single run for the Unit test. Best usecases are for pre-commit checks and in pipeline scripts.\nBoth scripts will provide a Code Coverage file, which can be found in './reports/coverage'\nRunning E2E tests with Protractor and Cucumber 🤓\nRun npm run test:e2e to execute the E2E protractor tests. Tests can be found within ./e2e all written in Cucumber style.\nThis test will provide an report which will be shown at the end of all tests. It can also be found in ./reports/e2e/report. When tests fails, there will be a screenshot attached to the scenario where the test has failed.\nKnown issue(s) 💊\nWhen npm run test:e2e fails to compile as of webdriver issues, run npm run test:e2e:fix-webdriver to fix this compile error and try again.\nDocumentation 🗃\n\nnpm run doc:full - create documentation with compodoc\nUnit test coverage\nE2E reports\nWPO reports\n\n\n\nsample can be fount at './documentation/index.html'\nWebsite Performance Optimization 🚀\n\nnpm run wpo:stats to get a clear view of all dependencies and their dependencies for your project.\nnpm run wpo:lighthouse to get a lighthouse score for your current project. (change the URL in ci/fetchLighthouse.js).\n\nMock data (MockServer) 🤩\nAs of version 1.1.0 it is possible to setup a mockServer with npm run server:mock. Port will be https://localhost:4000 and the different status can be set at https://localhost:4000/mocking. All data can be setup in './mockServer'. Examples of API, JSON and images are added.\nAs of version 2.1.0 the mockServer is running through Docker and runs with HTTPS/HTTP2\nWeb push\nDo a POST call to https://localhost:4000/notification to create a mocked push notification.\nBest can be tested after npm run build && npm run start:dist. The application will then be available at https://localhost:8081\nNOTE: for the mockserver to work for this production build use npm run server:mock:prod\nexample sites:\n\nIVY build - https://angular.rickvandermeij.nl\nPrerendering - https://angular-prerender.rickvandermeij.nl\nServer Side Rendering - npm run start:ssr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2019 Rick van der Meij\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
